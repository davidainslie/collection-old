Firstly, this module is named "collection-old", as it has been completely rewritten and will be re-released as "collection".
This module allows for a more API friendlier approach to working with collections.
Guava is far superior but as I started out with this module a long time ago (and have rewritten) it, I'm still biased towards using my own, even though I do use Guava.

Note, this is a Java 7, Maven 3 project.
